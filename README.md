Football Score predictions
Did Polynomial regression to get the home team scores and away team scores. Also did Logistic Regression to find out whether a match was a loss, win or draw.


The polynomial regression had a Root Mean Sqaured Error of 1.47 for the home team scores prediction. The away team had a model RMSE of 1.7. I perfromed cross validation and got on 700 models and got an RMSE of 0.8. 
The Logistic Regression model had an accuracy of 74%. I tuned the hyperparameters using the Random Search and got an improved accuracy of upto 99%.


Project Intro/Objective
I created three models. 
The first one predicts the home team scores
The second predicts the away team scores
The third finds out whether a match was a lose, draw or win.
